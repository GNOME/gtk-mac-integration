; This is a template accelerator map file for OSX. The lexical scanner
; thinks that it's scheme, so we might as well, too, at least as far
; as using ';' as a comment indicator. There's no scheme interpreter
; invoked on this, though, so don't think that you can set variables
; or anything like that.
;
; The basic format of each line is exemplified by
; (gtk_accel_path "<test-integration>/File/Open" "<Meta>o")
; for a menu item accelerator and 
; (gtk_accel_path "<Actions>/TestActions/OpenAction" "<Meta>o")
; for an action item accelerator. 
;  gtk_menu_set_accel_path(GTK_MENU(menu), "<test-integration>/File");
; and in the second, it's 
; gtk_action_group_new("TestActions");
;
; In the menu case, the accel_path is defined by the statement
; gtk_menu_set_accel_path(GTK_MENU(menu), "<test-integration>/File");
; in the program and then the "path" to the menu item with the
; accelerator. In the actions case, it's the combination of the fixed
; indicator <Actions>, the statement
; gtk_action_group_new("TestActions");, and the action name supplied
; to gtk_action_group_add_actions.
;
; The Gtk equivalent modifier keys are <Meta> for the Command Key;
; <Alt> (or <Mod1>) for the Option Key. <Control> and <Shift> do what
; you would expect. Note that if you use a capital letter for the key
; name GtkOSXApplication will assume that the Shift key is a required
; component of the modifier set.
;
; The following menu items are provided in Cocoa by GtkOSXApplication
; and do not need to be mapped:
; Hide: 		<Meta>h
; Hide Others		<Meta><Alt>h
; Minimize		<Meta>m
; Quit			<Meta>q
;
; For this file to have an effect, you must include the statement
; gtk_accel_map_load("file_path"); 
; somewhere in your program.
