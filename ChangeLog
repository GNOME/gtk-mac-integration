	* AUTHORS: Added myself to the AUTHORS file

	* configure.ac: Bump version to 0.8.4

	* data/ige-mac-integration.pc.in (Cflags): Added a define for
	MAC_INTEGRATION that clients can use to ifdef around integration
	code. 

2009-05-26  John Ralls  <john@manjusri.ceridwen.fremont.ca.us>

	* src/ige-mac-menu.c (sync_menu_shell): Moved the hiding code from
	carbon_menu_item update_submenu and added unhiding code. This now
	works correctly, at least in GnuCash.

	* src/ige-mac-menu.h: New function ige_mac_menu_sync() to update
	the main menu after changes (e.g., different menus for pages in a
	notebook). 

Note that Richard Hult's changes are documented only in the git log.
