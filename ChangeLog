2011-09-22  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * Makefile.am, acinclude.m4, strings/Makefile.am, strings/Makefile.in: Make
  package work with "make dist"  This took a couple of changes:
  strings/Makefile had to be redone to use automake instead of having a
  hand-written Makefile.in Provision had to be made for building all three
  python binding directories. For this to work, it's necessary to have both
  gtk+-2 and gtk+-3 installed along with pygobject-2, pygobject-3 and pygtk
  (and all the other pygtk dependencies), and to pass --enable-python=all to
  configure.

  * bindings/python/.gitignore, docs/reference/Makefile.am: More changes to
  reflect project name change

2011-09-20  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/gtkosxapplication.h, src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Remove
  deprecations for Gtk-mac-integration release 1.0.0

2011-09-15  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * gtk-mac-integration.doap: Add doap file for git.gnome.org

2011-06-05  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * strings/GtkOSXApplication.strings.fr: Bug 56: Better French Translations,
  thanks to gegeweb

2011-06-01  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * acinclude.m4: Fix a dumb typo which prevented building with Gtk+2

2011-05-26  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Remove the attempt to add the window title
  to the window menu.  First off, it's unnecessary: AppKit takes care of it.
  Second, it doesn't work because there's no GDK window until the window is
  realized, and most applications will call this during menu setup, before that
  happens.

  * src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Replace the single static emission_hook_id
  with stuffing the id for each main menu as a qdata on the menu shell.  This
  caused crit errors because only the last hook id created could be removed;
  when earlier-created windows were destroyed, parent_emission_hook_remove
  would try to remove the already-removed hook, throwing a critical error.

2011-05-20  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * ChangeLog: Update Changelog for 0.9.8 Release

  * configure.ac: Bump version to 0.9.8

  * bindings/python/gtk3_osxapplication/Makefile.am,
  bindings/python/gtk3_osxapplication/__init__.py,
  .../gtk_osxapplication-module.c, .../gtk_osxapplication.override,
  .../python/gtk3_osxapplication/test-integration.py: Add bindings which work
  with PyGI (replaced PyGtk).

2011-05-17  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * acinclude.m4, bindings/python/Makefile.am, configure.ac: Setup a new
  directory, bindings/python/gtk3_osxapplication for pygi (replacing pygtk for
  gtk3), and for making it instead of gtk_osxapplication if the gtk library is
  gtk3, Gtk-3.0.gir exists, and pygobject-2.28 or better is present.

2011-04-26  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/test-integration.c: Move the "Bounce" binding from "o" to "u" so that
  it doesn't conflict with File>Open.

  * src/GNSMenuItem.c, src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c, src/test-integration.c:
  Bug #52: Make Quartz accelerator handlers work in a gdk_threaded application.

  * .gitignore: Add m4 to the ignore list.

  * src/test-integration.c, src/testui.xml: Test for adding a window after
  starting the main loop; a tailored window menu is added to hold the command.

  * src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Force addition of the current window to the
  Window menu when a window menu is passed in. This is mostly needed for for
  the first window; the windows list gets created after the window, so it's not
  on the list.

  * src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Bug #53: Force a double menubar switch to
  suppress a second system menu icon (with no attached menu) from appearing in
  the menubar when a new window is created after starting the main loop.

2011-02-11  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Fix a warning about labels not being GObjects when
  there isn't a label (when the menu item is a separator).

  * src/cocoa_menu.c, src/cocoa_menu.h, src/cocoa_menu_item.c,
  src/cocoa_menu_item.h: Cleanup trailing whitespace.

2011-02-10  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/test-integration.c: Fix compile error with IGE_MAC_INTEGRATION defined.

2010-12-14  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * configure.ac: Bump version to 0.9.7

  * configure.ac: Clean up trailing whitespace in configure.ac

2010-11-28  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Fix key equivalents for Hide, Hide Others,
  and Minimize so that they don't require <Shift>; not standard per the Apple
  HIG. Thanks to Richard Proctor for pointing this out.

2010-10-05  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/test-integration.c: Revert e9a29d3d5ee06f88ce02b68a047e52b1e6f95f31. It
  turns out that you _do_ need to call gtk_window_add_accel_group, even when
  using GtkUIManager.

2010-10-01  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * bundle/Info.plist, bundle/launcher.sh, bundle/test-integration.bundle,
  src/test-integration.c: Add test for openfile.  Note that this makes a
  bundle, and the get_bundle_id() test will fail because it doesn't want to
  find a bundle id.

  * src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Correct parameter number error in
  g_cclosure_marshal_BOOLEAN__STRING

2010-09-13  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Cast to GNSMenuItem so that the setHidden
  method is found when building for Tiger.
  https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gtk-osx/ticket/41

2010-09-09  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c, src/test-integration.c: Use gdkkeysyms-compat for
  versions of Gtk after 2.90.7

  * src/GNSMenuItem.c: Add protection against index being out of range when
  unhiding a menu item.

2010-09-07  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * configure.ac: Bump Version to 0.9.6

  * accel_map: Add accel_map, used for test-integration.

2010-09-06  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/test-integration.c: test-integration: Enable BUILT_UI, fix a couple of
  compile errors for that option, load an accelerator map file.

2010-08-30  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Change keymask to reflect patch to gtk+ which maps
  NSCommandKeyMask to GDK_META_MASK

2010-08-29  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/GtkApplicationDelegate.c: Prevent reentry of signal emission in
  applicationShouldTermintate  GObject signal emissions are not reentrant, so
  if the program is in a handler and the program tries to emit another instance
  of the signal, that emission returns with a null result. In our case, that
  means that if one is handling a shouldTerminate and the user manages to issue
  another one (perhaps with the dock menu, which isn't affected by modal
  dialogs) the second shouldTerminate will receive an NSTerminateNow and the
  app will quit, perhaps while trying to save its file. Not so good.  This
  change prevents that by returning NSTerminateCancel if the app is waiting on
  a handler.

2010-08-27  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c, src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Restore
  cocoa_menu_item_connect to outside of not a separator; that was the wrong
  solution. Instead, explicitly unhide the inserted separated item in Cocoa.

2010-08-22  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Rework parent_set_emission_hook so that it
  returns immediately if neither the old nor the new parent have registered
  cocoa menus. It turns out that GtkComboBox uses a GtkMenu to keep its list,
  and trying to sync that menu was a common (and expensive) occurence.  Further
  reworked to just delete the menu item from the old NSMenu if there was one,
  and to re-synch the new parent menu if it's has a registered cocoa menu. (If
  it doesn't, then it hasn't been added yet and it will get synched when it
  is.)

  * src/GNSMenuItem.c, src/GNSMenuItem.h: Add a "removeItem" call to
  GNSMenuItem (only needed because of the inMenu and index member variables
  which exist when the target is 10.4)

  * src/gtkosxapplication.h: Remove the semicolons from the macro definitions;
  they caused errors when using the macros in the declaration section of a code
  block.

2010-08-15  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * configure.ac: Bump Version to 0.9.5

  * .../gtk_osxapplication/gtk_osxapplication.override,
  .../python/gtk_osxapplication/test-integration.py: Update python
  gtk_osxapplication bindings to reflect API changes.

2010-08-07  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/gtkosxapplication.h, src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c,
  src/test-integration.c: [#37] Deprecate
  gtk_osxapplication_add_app_menu_group() and
  gtk_osxapplication_add_app_menu_item() in favor of the much simpler
  gtk_osxapplication_insert_app_menu_item().  The new interface allows one to
  insert a separator item simply by creating a GtkSeparatorMenuItem and passing
  it. This enables a good deal more control than messing around with the
  groups, particularly if you want to add items at different points in the app
  setup process.

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Move connect_menu_item call inside the "not a
  separator branch"; unattached separators (those inserted by
  gtk_osxapplication_insert_app_menu_item in particular) were disappearing
  because they couldn't successfully connect.

2010-08-07  Richard Procter <richard.n.procter@gmail.com>

  * src/gtkosxapplication.h, src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c,
  src/test-integration.c: Make bundle functions "free"  No need for them to be
  member functions and save having to get an app pointer just for getting
  bundle info.  Renamed to quartz_application_foo with a defined alias to avoid
  suddenly breaking existing code, but the member function calls are deprecated
  and will be removed at version 1.0

2010-08-01  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c, src/test-integration.c: Correct the modifier key
  mappings.  Note that as of Gtk+-2.20, GDK_META_MASK is no longer mapped to
  the Command Keys, so it can't be used anymore. The correct keyword for
  Command in accelerator map files is now "Alt".

  * src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Protect the creation of the static
  GtkOSXApplication pointer with a GStaticMutex for thread safety.  (The GOnce
  version was misguided; GOnce is to protect thread creation objects, not
  singletons.)

2010-06-26  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/test-integration.c: Corrected ifdef error which prevented
  test-integration from building in GTKOSXAPPLICATION mode.

  * configure.ac: Bump version

  * src/test-integration.c: Clean up the ifdefs, which had gotten borked for
  IGEMACINTEGRATION.

  * src/test-integration.c: No need to call gtk_window_add_accel_group with
  BUILT_UI; GtkUIManager takes care of it for us.

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c, src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c, src/ige-mac-menu.c,
  src/test-integration.c: Replace deprecated function and macro calls to enable
  correct operation in gtk+-3.0

  * configure.ac, data/ige-mac-integration.pc.in: Enable building to gtk+-2.0
  or gtk+-3.0  Selectable at build time if both are available, defaulting to
  gtk+-3.0. If only one is available, it will abort if the wrong one is
  selected, otherwise it will build whichever one is available. 
  ige-mac-integration.pc will be set up accordingly. There is no provision for
  having both installed.

  * strings/Makefile.in: Correct conceptual error in strings clean target:
  Delete the Makefile for distclean, so that configure will create a new one.
  One can't very well have a make target to make the makefile.

  * acinclude.m4: Correct errors in Python detection script

2010-06-21  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * strings/Makefile.in: Add clean and distclean targets in strings

2010-06-20  Hamish Mackenzie <hamish.k.mackenzie@googlemail.com>

  * src/ige-mac-menu.c: Menu_event_handler_func: return eventNotHandledErr
  instead of calling the next event (which EventManager will do when it gets
  the eventNotHandledErr -- and if the next event returns it, then EventManager
  would call it again, uselessly)

2010-06-05  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Add standard key equivalents to selected
  menu items in Application and Window menus.

  * configure.ac: Bump version 0.9.3

  * README: Add pointer to the wiki page for more documentation.

  * data/template_accel_map: Template accelerator map file for converting
  standard accelerators to OSX-standard key equivalents.

  * src/test-integration.c: Move some code around to fix errors when BUILD_UI
  is undeffed.

2010-06-04  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * Makefile.am, configure.ac, strings/Makefile.in: Install the strings files.
  They'll go to $PREFIX/share/strings/foo.proj/GtkOSXApplication.strings (where
  "foo" is the appropriate language code).

  * strings/GtkOSXApplication.strings, strings/GtkOSXApplication.strings.en:
  Rename the english strings file to have the "en" suffix.

  * configure.ac: Use AC_CONFIG_FILES instead of the deprecated AC_OUTPUT().

  * strings/GtkOSXApplication.strings, strings/GtkOSXApplication.strings.ca,
  strings/GtkOSXApplication.strings.cs, strings/GtkOSXApplication.strings.da,
  strings/GtkOSXApplication.strings.de, strings/GtkOSXApplication.strings.es,

  strings/GtkOSXApplication.strings.tr, strings/GtkOSXApplication.strings.uk,
  strings/GtkOSXApplication.strings.vi,
  strings/GtkOSXApplication.strings.zh_CN,
  strings/GtkOSXApplication.strings.zh_TW: Add translations for menu labels

  * src/test-integration.c: Test Response to WillTerminateNotification signal.

2010-05-22  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Wrap static strings for translation.  We're
  using the apple translation mecanism here because the strings are coded in
  Cocoa.

  * src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c, src/gtkosxapplicationprivate.h: Create an
  object autorelease pool. Corrects some memory issues if the GtkOSXApplication
  object is created too early.

  * src/GtkApplicationNotify.c, src/gtkosxapplication.h,
  src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Make bundle functions return duplicated
  gchar* instead of the const gchar* pointing into the NSString object. This
  corrects some ugly memory leaks.

2010-05-20  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * configure.ac: Bump version

  * configure.ac, docs/Makefile.am: Make the creation of docs conditional on
  --enable-gtk-docs.

  * src/GtkApplicationNotify.c, src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c,
  src/test-integration.c: Add "will terminate" signal to fully support
  applications that use two-stage shutdown.

  * src/GNSMenuBar.c: Fix crash if help_menu or window_menu is no longer
  attached to the menu bar.

  * docs/Makefile.am, docs/reference/ige-mac-integration-docs.sgml: Additional
  required docs files... should have been added earlier.

  * src/gtkosxapplication.h, src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c,
  src/test-integration.c: Split setting up of the Help and Window menus as
  separate functions.  Adding them without asking was rude and added strings
  exposed to the user. No provision had been made for translating those strings
  -- and to do so would expose application ports to an unexpected requirement. 
  Now, if the application has a Window or Help menu, the application can
  designate it so that OSX will manage it correctly. If not, and if the
  application doesn't need translations, the menus can be created -- but this
  is intended mostly for testing rather than actual use.

2010-05-18  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c, src/cocoa_menu_item.h: Expose cocoa_menu_item_get as
  a public function.  Needed for separating gtk_osx_application_set_window_menu
  from gtk_osx_application_set_menu_bar

  * src/GNSMenuBar.c, src/GNSMenuBar.h, src/cocoa_menu_item.c,
  src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Change name of windowMenu to windowsMenu for
  consistency with NSApplication function

  * src/GNSMenuBar.c, src/GNSMenuBar.h: Provide accessor for GtkMenuBar*

  * src/GNSMenuBar.c: Better memory management in the unlikely case that the
  various memory items are changed.

  * configure.ac: Restore the docs Makefiles to AC_OUTPUT, mysteriously deleted
  in a merge.

2010-05-17  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * AUTHORS: Add Paul Davis.

  * src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c, src/gtkosxapplicationprivate.h: Add the
  notification object to self->priv to ensure its orderly destruction at
  shutdown.

  * src/GtkApplicationNotify.c: Add observation of NSApplicationWillTerminate
  and use that to clean up.

  * src/GtkApplicationDelegate.c: Change the return to shouldTerminate to
  NSTerminateCancel.  NSTerminateLater is for delaying termination, and
  termination is allowed to proceed when the application calls
  replyToShouldTerminate:. That doesn't make sense in a Gtk+ application, and
  besides, it leaves the CFEventLoop in a state where it won't accept other
  events.

  * src/gtkosxapplication.c: Minor documentation errors

  * src/GNSMenuItem.c, src/GNSMenuItem.h, src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Tiger
  compatibility fixes  The unhide mechanism was causing a crash due to
  recursion, fixed by setting hidden to false first instead of last; NSInteger
  was added in 10.5, but for now just calling it an int works fine.

2010-05-16  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * README: Fix URL in README

  * configure.ac: New version 0.9.0

  * README: Update README

  * docs/reference/Makefile.am, src/GNSMenuBar.h, src/GNSMenuItem.h,
  src/cocoa_menu_item.c, src/gtkosxapplication.c, src/gtkosxapplication.h:
  Finish Documentation

  * src/gtkosxapplication.h, src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Change return type
  of gtk_osxapplication_get_bundle_info to gchar*  Returning an NSObject* was a
  dumb idea, because it forces users to use ObjC to deal with it. There are
  only two likely return values from an Info.plist key anyway, a string (which
  this now accomodates) and a dictionary (which it doesn't, and which would be
  difficult to because of the possibility that the dictionary contains more
  dictionaries).

2010-05-14  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Fix some documentation typos.

  * src/gtkosxapplication.h: Documentation fixups.  In particular, move the
  signal comments to gtkosxapplication_quartz.c, where Gtk-doc seems to like
  them better,

  * docs/reference/Makefile.am: Gtk-docs Makefile tweaks to get it working.

  * Makefile.am: Add gtk-doc.make to distribution

  * configure.ac: Add the docs Makefiles so that docs get built

  * src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Move the signal creation from
  gtk_osxapplication_init to gtk_osxapplication_class_init.  Not only does
  Gtk-doc like this better, but it also makes more sense, because signals
  should be created only once. The fact that GtkOSXApplication is a singleton
  is the only thing that avoided trouble.

  * docs/reference/Makefile.am, src/gtkosxapplication.c,
  src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: First pass at documentation.

  * Makefile.am, configure.ac: Enable running Gtk-Doc to build documentation;
  update minimum version to 1.11, the one in the current stable moduleset.

  * src/GtkApplicationDelegate.c, src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Make
  gtk_osxapplication_dock_menu() appear private to Gtk-Doc by renaming it
  _gtk_osxapplication_dock_menu()

2010-05-13  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * bindings/python/Makefile.am, configure.ac: Disable compilation of
  igemacintegration python bindings when compiling for 64-bit is enabled.  Note
  that this will either prevent build the python bindings or the build will
  break when building universal.

  * src/ige-mac-bundle.c, src/ige-mac-bundle.h, src/ige-mac-dock.c,
  src/ige-mac-dock.h, src/ige-mac-menu.c, src/ige-mac-menu.h,
  src/test-integration.c: Conditionally compile Carbon-dependent functions in
  32-bit only.

  * src/gtkosxapplication.h: PyGObject-codegen needs to see "self" to recognize
  a class method

  * configure.ac: Minor typo in AC_OUTPUT

  * bindings/python/gtk_osxapplication/__init__.py,
  .../gtk_osxapplication/gtk_osxapplication.override,
  .../python/gtk_osxapplication/test-integration.py: Complete python bindings
  for GtkOSXApplication

  * src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Correct marshaller arguments in
  NSApplicationOpenFile signal creation.

  * src/gtkosxapplication.h, src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Give
  gtk_application_sync_menubar a GtkOSXApplication* argument so that h2defs.py
  will recognize it as a member function.

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Rename cocoa_menu_item_sync_state to
  cocoa_menu_item_sync  To avoid confusion, because it calls several update
  functions, including one called cocoa_menu_item_update_state.

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Remove redundant hide command from
  cocoa_menu_item_sync_state. (cocoa_menu_item_update_state handles hidden and
  sensitive properties)

2010-05-11  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Remove the menu item hide in
  gtk_osxapplication_add_app_menu_item.  The menu item is removed from the
  original quartz menu, and menus are not resynced the same way in Cocoa, so
  it's unnecessary. Also, in PyGtk, it was hiding the menu item on the Apple
  menu. (I guess the interesting question is why doesn't it hide it in C?)

  * src/gtkosxapplication.h: Change comment type, because pygobject's h2defs
  pukes on C++-style.

  * .../python/gtk_osxapplication/gtk_osxapplication.c,
  src/GtkApplicationDelegate.c: Fix minor bug and remove testing comment.

2010-05-10  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * .gitignore: Add compiled python and wrapper-intermediate files to ignore
  list.

  * src/GtkApplicationDelegate.c, src/gtkosxapplication.h,
  src/gtkosxapplication_quartz.c: Provide a signal for NSApplicationDelegate
  openFile:  Replaces the GtkOSXApplication instance function should_open_file
  which was a no-op anyway.

  * bindings/python/Makefile.am,
  bindings/python/gtk_osxapplication/Makefile.am,
  .../gtk_osxapplication/gtk_osxapplication-module.c,
  .../python/gtk_osxapplication/gtk_osxapplication.c,

  .../gtkosxapplication/gtk_osxapplication-module.c,
  .../python/gtkosxapplication/gtk_osxapplication.c,
  .../gtkosxapplication/gtk_osxapplication.override: Rename
  bindings/python/gtkosxapplication to gtk_osxapplication to work consistently
  with the wrapper module name.

2010-05-09  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * .../gtkosxapplication/gtk_osxapplication-module.c,
  .../python/gtkosxapplication/gtk_osxapplication.c,
  .../gtkosxapplication/gtk_osxapplication.override: Basic python wrapper for
  gtkosxapplication.

  * bindings/python/Makefile.am, bindings/python/gtkosxapplication/Makefile.am,
  bindings/python/igemacintegration/Makefile.am,
  .../igemacintegration/igemacintegration.override, configure.ac: Modify
  makefiles and configure for moving the ige_mac_integration wrapper to a
  subdirectory of bindings/python. Provide a makefile for the gtkosxapplication
  binding.  Dunno what the relative path to the headers was about, but I fixed
  it anyway.

  src/test-integration.c: Symbol changes to be compatible with
  pygobject-codegen  Codegen wants to generate macros named GTK_OSX_APPLICATION
  instead of GTK_OSXAPPLICATION, so this change mollifies it. It's also
  persnickety about having a GType macro for the named enum
  GtkOSXApplicationAttentionType because it's used as a parameter to a
  function, so this change provides that as well.

  * acinclude.m4: Fix m4 function IMENDIO_PYTHON_CHECK for codegen moving from
  pygtk to pygobject.  This includes updating the minimum requiements for PyGtk
  to 2.14 and introducing a requirement for PyGObject 2.16 or greater, as these
  are the releases in which that change was made.  Note that this is being
  tested against git masters, so it's possible (though unlikely) that there
  will be changes required once it's checked against moduleset-stable.

  src/gtkosxapplicationprivate.h, src/test-integration.c: Rename GtkApplication
  to GtkOSXApplication  There has been some discussion on gtk-dev about
  creating one or more application classes, and GtkApplication is one of the
  proposed names. Since very little of this class has anything to do with
  anything other than Cocoa at this point, it seems prudent to change the name
  and avoid a potential collision if a GtkApplication class ever becomes part
  of Gtk.

  * src/GtkApplicationDelegate.c, src/gtkapplication.c, src/gtkapplication.h,
  src/gtkapplication_quartz.c, src/test-integration.c: Reconfigure
  GtkApplicationDelegate to use a signal for applicationShouldTerminate.

2010-05-07  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/GtkApplicationNotify.c, src/gtkapplication.c, src/gtkapplication.h,
  src/gtkapplication_quartz.c, src/test-integration.c: GtkApplicationNotify
  emits signals instead of calling a hard-coded function in GtkApplication. 
  This is vastly more flexible, and helps eliminate the need to subclass
  GtkApplication to get reasonable behavior.

  * src/gtkapplication.h, src/gtkapplication_quartz.c, src/test-integration.c:
  Add bundle functions

2010-05-06  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/gtkapplication.h, src/gtkapplication_quartz.c, src/test-integration.c:
  Finish dock functions in GtkApplication, and tests for same to
  test-integration.c  Things that work: Change Icon, Set Menu,
  AttentionRequest. Change overlay is removed from 10.5 and later, and so not
  implemented.  Dragging a file to the dock tile doesn't trigger ShouldOpen.

  * src/GtkApplicationDelegate.c: Repair a couple of minor typos in
  GtkApplicationDelegate.c

  * src/ige-mac-menu.c: Add a protective check against a null menu shell.

  * src/ige-mac-menu.c: Fix a typo, add some descriptive comments

  * src/ige-mac-menu.c: Fix crasher from last change  The submenu in the
  deleted fragment wasn't initialized, and so the test was bogus -- with
  predictable results. If it was a submenu, carbon_menu_item_update_submenu had
  already run sync_menu_shell anyway.

2010-05-04  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/ige-mac-image-utils.c: Add comment indicating that ige-mac-image-utils
  does not need to be rewritten to support 64-bit compilation.

  * src/gtkapplication.h: Comments separating function prototypes by what they
  do.

  * src/GtkApplicationDelegate.c, src/gtkapplication.h,
  src/gtkapplication_quartz.c, src/gtkapplicationprivate.h: Add dock menu
  support

  * src/test-integration.c: Comments for #endifs; it's getting pretty
  complicated!

2010-04-25  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Don't do anything if the old item and new item
  match.

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Disconnect the old signal instead of ignoring the
  fact that the coocoa_item has changed.  It often happens in cases when adding
  or removing menu items that a new cocoa_menu_item will be created and
  attached. The original version of this would check to see if there was
  already an item set on the GtkMenuItem and if there was, would leave the old
  signal connected and pointing to the wrong NSMenuItem. This change
  disconnects the old signals and connects new ones with the right data so that
  the handler can invoke the right Cocoa object.

  * src/test-integration.c: Provide a QUARTZ_HANDLERS macro to turn on allowing
  quartz to handle keyboard accelerators.

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Provide for synchronizing deletion of menu items.

  * src/GNSMenuBar.c, src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: When syncronizing the main
  menu bar ensure that the Window menu gets put back in the right place.

2010-04-24  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * bindings/python/__init__.py: Wrap ige_mac_menu_sync for python bindings

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Some safety improvements in
  cocoa_menu_item_add_submenu

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Oops. Clean the submenu and return if there *isn't*
  a Gtk submenu, not if there is!

  * src/gtkapplication_quartz.c, src/test-integration.c: Editorial cleanup and
  comments

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Change all instances of NSMenuItem in
  cocoa_menu_item.c to GNSMenuItem to make sure that pointers don't get
  corrupted by slicing.

  * src/addedui.xml, src/test-integration.c, src/testui.xml: Add a button which
  adds/removes a new menu item to/from the menu bar to test and demonstrate
  programmatic menu synchronization. BUILT_UI only.

  * src/test-integration.c: Move menu_data_cb functions outside of the ifndef
  BUILT_UI block so that they can be used with BUILT_UI

  * src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: Track osx-controlled special menus (Apple,
  Windows, and if needed, Help) so that their positions can be adjusted after
  modifications to the menubar.

  * src/GNSMenuItem.c, src/GNSMenuItem.h: Add a notUsed instance variable with
  manipulation so that GNSMenuItems whose Gtk counterparts have been deleted
  programmatically with signals disconnected can be identified and removed.

  * src/GNSMenuBar.c, src/GNSMenuBar.h: Add parameters with accessors for the 3
  OSX special menus so that their positions can be maintained.

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Handle resync of an existing submenu  As originally
  written, the cocoa_menu_item_add_menu_item could handle only additions to the
  menu. This modification allows one to resync an existing menu item with its
  Gtk counterpart, including deletions and state changes which occur without
  the signal being emitted (because it's happening under program control with
  the signal disconnected). Not completely working yet.

2010-04-17  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/test-integration.c, src/testui.xml: Add a Help item to the Help menu in
  BUILT_UI to force the Help menu to be visible after the About menu item is
  moved.

  * src/test-integration.c: Clean up line endings

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Tidy up some word-wrapping

  * src/GNSMenuItem.c: Fix errors in the Tiger menu-item-hiding code; now
  tested and working properly.

  * src/GNSMenuItem.h: Make the "action" instance variable private.

  * src/GNSMenuBar.c, src/GNSMenuBar.h, src/gtkapplication.h,
  src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: Provide for resyncing an already-set menubar. 
  This is done at two levels: A function gtk_application_sync_menubar is
  provided for client applications to call from C, but it just asks the
  currently-active menubar to resync. That's implemented by a new function
  GNSMenuBar -resync. For it to work, GNSMenubar needs to know what GtkMenuBar
  it's associated with, so a new private instance variable and a new
  initializer are provided as well. GNSMenuBar's instance variable
  app_menu_groups is made private as well, just for cleanliness.

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Separate state syncronization into a separate
  function, rename cocoa_menu_item_active to cocoa_menu_item_checked, and 
  provide for setting checked menu items to "NSMixedState" when the
  corresponding GtkCheckedMenuItem has its "inconsistent" property set to true.

2010-04-16  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/test-integration.c: Provide test of disabling quartz key equivalents.

  * src/test-integration.c: Fix up the tests of accelerators so that they
  respond correctly to changes from e.g., gtkrc files.

  * src/test-integration.c: Change the menu_item_activate callback to toggle
  the sensitiviy of Edit>Copy rather than turn it off once.

  * src/gtkapplication.c, src/gtkapplication.h, src/gtkapplication_quartz.c,
  src/gtkapplicationprivate.h: Provide for disabling of Quartz menu accelerator
  (aka keyEquivalents) for apps which need to do their own.  For example, if an
  app has over-ridden the acccelerator closure for some reason, the quartz
  handling will call the menu item rather than the accelerator's closure.

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Prettier formatting.

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Use Tiger menu item hiding.

  * src/GNSMenuItem.c, src/GNSMenuItem.h: Provide menu-item hiding for Tiger
  (not tested) and enable it for Leopard and later (tested).

  * src/GNSMenuBar.c: Clean out debugging message

2010-04-15  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c, src/cocoa_menu_item.h: Remove
  cocoa_menu_item_add_action; it isn't needed.

  * src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: Force passing of windowless (read Apple)
  accelerators to the main menu bar.

  * src/gtkapplication.h, src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: Remove
  "in_event_menu_handler" Don't know why this was here, it isn't used.

  * src/test-integration.c: Delete stray leftover from adding accelerators

2010-04-12  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: A little cleanup

  * src/testui.xml: UI file for test program GtkUIManager ui.

  * src/gtkapplication.c: Make the diagnostic signal handler messages DEBUG()
  macros.

  * src/cocoa_menu.c: Suppress critical error message if cocoa_menu_get is
  called before the quark is set.

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c, src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: Turn off debug
  messagesin cocoa_menu_item and gtkapplication_quartz

  * src/ige-mac-menu.c: Add some documentation and a guard to prevent calling
  ige_mac_menu_sync() before ige_mac_menu_set_menubar();

  * src/test-integration.c: Add to the test program a GtkUIManager ui with
  actions instead of menuitems doing the work.

  * src/test-integration.c: Add signal handler to override
  gtk_widget_can_activate_accel for the hidden menubar; makes menu accelerators
  work.  Gtk by default disables accelerators on GtkMenuItems which aren't
  visible -- but it provides a signal for overriding this. By providing a
  signal handler to the menubar (which is what's hidden because we're
  displaying our own), we enable the accelerators. This wasn't a problem in
  ige-mac-menu, because it intercepts the NSEvents and dispatches them itself.

2010-04-09  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: Fix Window menu to include the first-opened
  window.

2010-04-06  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/GNSMenuBar.c, src/GNSMenuBar.h, src/Makefile.am, src/gtkapplication.c,
  src/gtkapplication.h, src/gtkapplication_quartz.c,
  src/gtkapplicationprivate.h: Fix app_menu tracking  There wasn't a good way
  that I could see to get the GtkMenuBar from
  gtk_application_add_app_menu_item, so I derived a subclass of NSMenu,
  GNSMenuBar, to hold the GList * for the menu groups. Everything else here
  tracks that change.

2010-04-04  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/gtkapplication_quartz.c, src/gtkapplicationprivate.h: Create a Window
  menu, always inserting it just to the left of the Help menu if there is one,
  or on the end if there isn't.

  * src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: Modify create_app_menu to always insert the
  app menu at index 0.

  * src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: Modify add_to_menubar to take a position
  indicating where on the menubar to add the new menu.

  * src/gtkapplication.c: Fix forgotten parameter in g_print in
  gtk_application_should_load.

  * src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: Comment out add_to_app_menu and
  add_to_window_menu  They're not currently used and they were throwing
  warnings.

  * src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: Replace interface extension and direct call to
  [NSApp setAppleMenu:] with indirect call  Gets rid of two warnings.

  * src/ige-mac-menu.c: Move update_active, update_accel_closure, and
  _update_submenu from carbon_menu_item_create to sync_menu_shell so that
  changes to these things will be synchronized even if the menu itself isn't
  changed.

  * src/ige-mac-bundle.c, src/ige-mac-bundle.h, src/ige-mac-dock.c,
  src/ige-mac-dock.h, src/ige-mac-image-utils.c, src/ige-mac-image-utils.h,
  src/ige-mac-integration.h, src/ige-mac-menu.c, src/ige-mac-menu.h,
  src/ige-mac-private.h: Correct license from GPL to LGPL.

  * src/GtkApplicationDelegate.c, src/gtkapplication.c, src/gtkapplication.h:
  Correct behavior of [GtkApplicationDelegate ApplicationShouldQuit], signature
  and behavior of gtk_application_should_quit, and comments about other
  AppDelegate functions.

  * src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: Connect window_focus_cb to the signal.

  * src/gtkapplication.h, src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: Restore the use of a
  menu item for gtk_application_add_app_menu_item, because it turns out that
  while Carbon has only one App menu shared among all menubars, Cocoa has one
  for every menubar.

  * src/gtkapplication_quartz.c, src/gtkapplicationprivate.h: Move the menubar
  from being owned by the GtkApplication (which limits us to one menubar) to
  being owned by each window, since in Gtk each window has its own menubar (or
  doesn't have one at all -- which might crash the application when the
  menuless window receives focus.)

  * src/cocoa_menu.c: Allow cocoa_menu_get to be called (and to return NULL) if
  cocoa_menu_connect hasn't yet been called.

  * src/test-integration.c: Set up defines for testing either no menu mangling,
  Carbon menu mangling (IGEMACMENU) or Cocoa menu mangling (GTKAPPLICATION).

  * src/test-integration.c: Add explanitory comment about menu action callback

  * src/test-integration.c: Add reminder for test coverage

  * src/test-integration.c: Renable testing two windows.

  * src/test-integration.c: Create accelerators on the File menu to test
  accelerator function.

  * src/Makefile.am: Restore ige-mac-menu to the library for testing and
  backwards-compatibility.

2010-04-02  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/gtkapplication.h, src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: Change signature of
  gtk_application_add_app_menu_item to take a label, closure, and data pointer
  instead of a menu_item.  The App menu doesn't change with the rest of the
  menubar when the window changes, and its items have to be independent of
  windows and their menu items. This allows one to associate a callback
  directly with the app menu item so that it can be invoked directly from the
  app menu instead of being mediated by a GtkMenuItem.

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Call g_cclosure_new_object_swap instead of
  g_cclosure_new  This way the closure is freed if menu_item is, and the
  callback function is invoked with closure.data instead of the (empty)
  passed-in pointer.

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Change calls to [GNSMenuItem initWithTitle] to
  comply with new signature.

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c, src/cocoa_menu_item.h: New function
  cocoa_menu_item_add_action to take a closure and a gpointer to other data so
  that an arbitrary two-parameter (one in closure.data and one in the gpointer)
  function wrapped in a closure can be used as a callback to the added
  CocoaMenuItem, for use in menus that aren't changed with the window.

  * src/GNSMenuItem.c, src/GNSMenuItem.h: New ClosureData struct 
  g_cclosure_marshal_VOID__VOID passes two arguments to the closure function:
  The closure.data (set when the closure is created, called the instance) and a
  second passed in a GValue. (g_closure_invoke is just a conduit function for
  the marshaller set on the closure).  Most of the GSignal functions get this
  wrong, and copy closure.data into the GValue.  We set up a structure with the
  closure and the pointer and use the pointer to create the GValue.

2010-03-27  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/GNSMenuItem.c, src/GNSMenuItem.h, src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Change
  GNSMenuItem to take a GClosure for its second argument instead of a
  GtkMenuItem.  This allows us to substitute menu callbacks (by wrapping them
  in closures) instead of having to intermediate through the menu item. We need
  this ability in the short term to create window-independent menu items for
  the app(le) menu and in the longer term for moving this functionality into
  Gtk+.

2010-03-25  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/GtkApplicationNotify.c, src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: Call
  [NSApplication sharedApplication] exactly once during GtkApplication init,
  and use the global NSApp elsewhere.

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c, src/cocoa_menu_item.h, src/gtkapplication_quartz.c:
  Rename carbon_menu_item_add_submenu to cocoa_menu_item_add_submenu. Oops!

  * src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: Use the saved app_menu instead of retrieving
  submenu 0.

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: Move, rather than skip, an existing NSMenuItem.

  * src/cocoa_menu_item.c: minor reformat for readability

  * src/test-integration.c: Invoke gtk_application_ready() before starting the
  event loop. This tells NSApp that the menus are ready; leave it out and the
  menubar isn't populated.

  * src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: Cleanup extra includes and put all exported
  functions together.

  * src/Makefile.am, src/cocoa_menu.c, src/cocoa_menu.h, src/cocoa_menu_item.c,
  src/cocoa_menu_item.h, src/getlabel.c, src/getlabel.h,
  src/gtkapplication_quartz.c: Split up overly-long gtkapplication_quartz.c
  into more manageable (and object-specific) files.

2010-03-23  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/test-integration.c: Use GtkApplication menu functions instead of
  ige-mac-menu.

  * autogen.sh: Upgrade to automake-1.10

  * configure.ac: Bump version to 0.8.6

  * src/ige-mac-menu.c: Clear the menubar when a window is deleted. Still have
  to manually refocus to another window in the app, but this is a gtk+-quartz

  * src/ige-mac-menu.c: Destroy the Carbon Menu/MenuItem when freeing the
  CarbonMenu/CarbonMenuItem that points to it.

  * src/ige-mac-menu.c: Decrement CarbonMenuItem index when it's only 1 high
  (i.e., after a menu item deletion) instead of deleting and recreating the
  MenuItem.

2009-07-28  John Ralls <jralls@ceridwen.us>

  * src/ige-mac-menu.c: Use carbon_menu_item_get_checked where needed
