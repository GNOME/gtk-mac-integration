Changes from version gtk-mac-integration-2.0.0 to version
	gtk-mac-integration-2.0.1:
* This is a minor bug-fix release.

gtk-mac-integration-2.0.0:

*  Now fully compatible with gobject-introspection and useable with Gtk3 gi
   bindings.
      Note: Gtk_OSXApplication is now GtkOsx_Application to avoid namespace
       collision with Gtk. This requires minor changes to application code.
      Note: Bundle functions (quartz_application_foo) have been renamed to
       gtkosx_application_foo so that they are introspected.
      Note: Introspection of Gtk2 doesn't work, so it's ignored in
       GtkOsxApplication. Gtk2 python applications should continue to use pyGtk.
*  Change 'NSAlternate' to be used with GDK_MOD1_MASK, matching changes
         in Gtk keyhandling.
*  Add support for icons in menus.
*  Fix object release issues found with Clang static analysis

gtk-mac-integration-1.0.1:

* Add two files to extra_dist: Both are necessary for testing, but not
  otherwise.

* Fix strings/Makefile.am so that the strings files are installed
  where they belong rather than in /strings.

gtk-mac-integration-1.0.0:

* The major change here is the project name, from ige-mac-integration,
  part of moving the project to Gnome.org. All functons and symbols
  that started with ige now start with gtk instead.

* Deprecated forms of bundle access functions removed.

* Making distribution tarballs with make dist now works. See the
  maintainer note in README.

* The annoying bug typo which caused the python bindings to not build
  against Gtk2 is fixed.

ige-mac-integration-0.9.8:

* Gtk3 Support added. Includes a new PyGObject introspection binding,
  gtk3_osxapplication.

* Fixed a crash when using Quartz accelerator handlers with
  multi-threaded applications.

* Fixed a bug which caused the menubar to display two Apple icons.
