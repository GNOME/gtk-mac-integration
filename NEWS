Changes from version gtk-mac-integration-2.0.7 to version
	gtk-mac-integration-2.0.8

* Provide a default gtk-mac-integration.pc, a copy of
      gtk-mac-integration-gtk2.pc unless gtk-mac-integration-gtk3.pc is the
      only version built. Applications are advised not to use it; it's only to
      avoid gratuitous breakage in single-gtk environments.
* Get GtkApplicationDelegate's application:openFile: handler to work at startup.
      It fires off the signal before the main loop has started, so stash the
      URI in a static for applicationDidFinishLaunching to fire the signal.
* Bug 744597 - Document that gtk_menu_reorder_child() doesn't update the menu.
* Update documents for current version of Gtk-Docs.
* Fix compile error on Leopard & Tiger.
* Minor build system improvements
* Make it possible to override libtoolize
* Get PyGObject-2.0's datadir from pkg-config
* Update .gitignore
* Fix autotools warnings and modernize some
* Use seperate configure flags for gtk2 and gtk3
      Changes --with-gtk=gtk2 (which was broken) to --with-gtk2 and --with-gtk3
      This allows you to build against both at the same time.
      None of the pkgconfig files should have been changed but there is only
      a single includedir now since they are the same.
* Use gnome-autogen.sh

Changes from version gtk-mac-integration-2.0.3 to version
	gtk-mac-integration-2.0.4:
* A double-release bug fix. Crasher! Don't use 2.0.3!

Changes from version gtk-mac-integration-2.0.2 to version
	gtk-mac-integration-2.0.3:
* A bugfix to allow compilation on Tiger and Leopard systems

Changes from version gtk-mac-integration-2.0.1 to version
	gtk-mac-integration-2.0.2:
* Ready for Mavericks and Xcode 5.0
* Make the App(le) Menu more Mac-like, with the App-name appended to
  Hide, Quit, and any items added to the zeroth entry (normally About).
* Suppress leading, trailing, and consecutive separators in menus
* Other bug-fixes. See ChangeLog.

Changes from version gtk-mac-integration-2.0.0 to version
	gtk-mac-integration-2.0.1:
* This is a minor bug-fix release.

gtk-mac-integration-2.0.0:

*  Now fully compatible with gobject-introspection and useable with Gtk3 gi
   bindings.
      Note: Gtk_OSXApplication is now GtkOsx_Application to avoid namespace
       collision with Gtk. This requires minor changes to application code.
      Note: Bundle functions (quartz_application_foo) have been renamed to
       gtkosx_application_foo so that they are introspected.
      Note: Introspection of Gtk2 doesn't work, so it's ignored in
       GtkOsxApplication. Gtk2 python applications should continue to use pyGtk.
*  Change 'NSAlternate' to be used with GDK_MOD1_MASK, matching changes
         in Gtk keyhandling.
*  Add support for icons in menus.
*  Fix object release issues found with Clang static analysis

gtk-mac-integration-1.0.1:

* Add two files to extra_dist: Both are necessary for testing, but not
  otherwise.

* Fix strings/Makefile.am so that the strings files are installed
  where they belong rather than in /strings.

gtk-mac-integration-1.0.0:

* The major change here is the project name, from ige-mac-integration,
  part of moving the project to Gnome.org. All functons and symbols
  that started with ige now start with gtk instead.

* Deprecated forms of bundle access functions removed.

* Making distribution tarballs with make dist now works. See the
  maintainer note in README.

* The annoying bug typo which caused the python bindings to not build
  against Gtk2 is fixed.

ige-mac-integration-0.9.8:

* Gtk3 Support added. Includes a new PyGObject introspection binding,
  gtk3_osxapplication.

* Fixed a crash when using Quartz accelerator handlers with
  multi-threaded applications.

* Fixed a bug which caused the menubar to display two Apple icons.
