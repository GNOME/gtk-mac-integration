gtk-mac-integration-1.0.1:

* Add two files to extra_dist: Both are necessary for testing, but not
  otherwise.

* Fix strings/Makefile.am so that the strings files are installed
  where they belong rather than in /strings.

gtk-mac-integration-1.0.0:

* The major change here is the project name, from ige-mac-integration,
  part of moving the project to Gnome.org. All functons and symbols
  that started with ige now start with gtk instead.

* Deprecated forms of bundle access functions removed.

* Making distribution tarballs with make dist now works. See the
  maintainer note in README.

* The annoying bug typo which caused the python bindings to not build
  against Gtk2 is fixed.

ige-mac-integration-0.9.8:

* Gtk3 Support added. Includes a new PyGObject introspection binding,
  gtk3_osxapplication.

* Fixed a crash when using Quartz accelerator handlers with
  multi-threaded applications.

* Fixed a bug which caused the menubar to display two Apple icons.
