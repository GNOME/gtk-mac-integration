Gtk-mac-integration Version 2.0.8
Provides integration for Gtk+ applications into the Mac desktop, with support for the Mac menubar, the Dock, and for finding resources in bundles.

This library provides two implementations: An older Carbon
implementation (gtk-mac-integration) and a new implementation in Cocoa
(GtkosxApplication). PyGtk bindings are provided for both, and
GtkosxApplication is gobject-introspectable.

GtkosxApplication compiles and works with x86_64, a major failing of
the Carbon implementation, as well as resolving some other glaring
bugs. Since Apple has deperecated Carbon in OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard)
and is likely to remove it from a future version of the operating
system removed parts of it from 10.9, Gtk-mac-integration is also
deprecated. New ports of Gtk+ applications should use
GtkosxApplication and maintainers of older ports are strongly
encouraged to convert as soon as practical.

NB: Applications already using Gtk+-3.4 and GLib 2.36 and later should
use the GApplication/GtkApplication and GMenuModel/GMenu APIs which
make this library unnecessary.

For a rather complex example on how to use the various flavors, see
src/test-integration.c. Basic examples of using the Python bindings
will be found in their respective directories under bindings/python.

GtkosxApplication is well documented using Gtk-Doc. To build the
documentation, pass --enable-gtk-doc to configure. A current copy may
be found online at
http://gtk-osx.sourceforge.net/gtk-mac-integration/index.html.

Some documentation for gtk-mac-integration along with more about
GtkosxApplication may be found at
https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GTK%2B/OSX/

Gtk-mac-integration may be built for either Gtk+-2, Gtk+-3, or since
version 2.0.7 both. Because it's not possible to link both
libgtk-quartz-2.0.dylib and libgtk-3.dylib, from version 2.0.7 on it
builds libgtkmacintegration-gtk2.dylib and/or
libgtkmacintegration-gtk3.dylib and provides separate pkgconfig files,
gtk-mac-integration-gtk2.pc and gtk-mac-integration-gtk3.pc, for the
respective gtk library versions. Since version 2.0.8 it also provides
gtk-mac-integration.pc which is a copy of gtk-mac-integration-gtk2.pc
*unless only libgtk-mac-integration-gtk3 is built*. This is to avoid
breakage of applications last updated before version
2.0.7. Application maintainers are urged not to depend on this as it
may not work in all environments and to update their applications to
use the appropriate version-specific pc file.


MAINTAINER NOTE:

Tarballs for distribution may be made with `make dist`, but in order
to include all three versions of python bindings this requires special
preparation:

* Build both Gtk2 and Gtk3

* Build PyGObject2 and PyGObject3. PyGObject2 must be built with
  --disable-introspection in order for it to be installed in parallel
  with PyGObject3.

* Build PyGtk.

* Configure gtk-mac-integration with --python=all.
